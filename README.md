# Bangla-HCR-Using-CNN

An Automated System for Recognizing Isolated Handwritten Bangla Characters using Deep Convolutional Network

The research utilized a publicly available dataset, CMATERdb 3.1.2 for its classification purpose. A deep novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of a total of 11 layers is proposed for classification task. This deep CNN model was trained to classify Bangla basic isolated characters of 50 classes (each class representing a character).


Performance of the Model:

Training dataset	(10800 Samples)	98.74%

Validation dataset	(1200 Samples)	97.75%

Test dataset	(3000 Samples)	98.03%
